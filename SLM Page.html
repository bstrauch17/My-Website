      <h2>SLM Printed Heat Exchanger: Northrop Grumman</h2>
		<div class="Background">
		<h3> Background </h3>
      <p>A team of four other students and I were tasked with designing a finned plate heat exchanger coupon for aerospace and defense industry challenges such as radar for a final project. We were instructed to design for maximum heat transfer and for minimum hydrodynamic resistance. Additionally, our instructions called for us to design for additive manufacturing as well, specifically SLM (selective laser melting) in order to develop novel fin geomtries that are unachievable via unconventional methods.</p>

	  <div class="Research">
		<h3> Research </h3>
      <p>We first began by researching the strengths of SLM, which is the generation of unique geomtries and angles that cannot be performed by normal manufacturing such as CNC, injection molding, or brazing. SLM allows for more complexity at smaller scale which allows us to design fin geomtries with more "range of motion". We discovered that curved fins resulted in more surface area for heat transfer, and we can couple that with the small scale manufacturing of SLM to group them closer together. </p>

      <p>We ended up combining airfoil style fins as well as pin fins in the corners. We decided on the airfoil style fins for the straight paths as they they are efficient, and our curved fin shape adds extra surface area for heat transfer. We elected to go with pins in most of the corners in order to hopefullly allow the water to flow easier, as well as enable the water to mix flows and become turbulent, increasing heat transfer. We designed a curved path for the water around one corner as an experiment to see if flow was better there, as we only got to test one design. Flow was still good around that corner, however the pins offered the most volume for fluid flow. </p>

      <div class="Test">
		  <h3> Testing </h3>
      <p>Testing of the heat exchanger was done by placing the coupon on a hot plate at a control temperature, and pumping water (also at a control temperature) through the channel. Effectiveness was measured by analyzing the temperature of the water at the outlet of the heat exchanger. Results are discussed below. </p>

      <div class="Results">
		  <h3> Results </h3>
      <p> Using the results below, we were able to get a max temperature difference of 3.6 degrees Celsius, and a hydrodynamic resistance of 0.218 mBar-min per microliter. </p>
